### The Facts

Over 95% of the [170,000 registered charities][1] in England and Wales, and the [25,000 in Scotland][2], are operating on [annual incomes below Â£1m](3).

This is against a backdrop of the ongoing [UK Cost-Of-Living Crisis][4] which continues to create increases in service demand, whilst tragically [increasing costs for 97% of our charities][5].


### The Impact

With 72% of charities already [struggling to afford essential tools][6] and 62% [in desperate need of improved technology skills][6], many organisations are simply being left behind, leaving our families, community and society without the critical support they rely on.

Without urgent action, this crisis will only deepen.
