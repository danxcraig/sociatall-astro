### Can You Make An Impact?
**Yes, you can absolutely make an impact.** 
The Small Charity Technology Crisis is a complex challenge—and complex challenges need diverse voices, skills, and solutions.

### Helping Now
Sociatall is currently in the **Research** phase, gathering insights from those who understand the sector and its challenges firsthand. 

We need insights from charity professionals facing daily tech struggles, community leaders witnessing unmet needs and researchers with time and data to contribute.

If that's you, or if it sounds like somebody you know, we'd love to hear from you.

### Helping Later
Building the right solution will take strategy, operations, and delivery knowhow—which means a breadth of expertise and collaboration to get work done.

If you feel connected to this cause and want to contribute to any of the areas of work in the menu, even if you're unsure how right now, we’d love to have a conversation.
