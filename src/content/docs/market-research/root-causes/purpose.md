Understanding the root causes of this challenge is critical for developing effective, long-term solutions.

By uncovering why small charities struggle with technology and skills, Sociatall can design better programs that remove barriers, rather than just mitigating their effects. Whether through tailored training, affordable tech solutions, or strategic partnerships, addressing root causes ensures that small charities can focus on their core mission—serving communities and changing lives.

This section aims to detail current understanding of root causes in order to:

## Target Interventions

Without understanding the fundamental reasons behind small charities' struggles, efforts to help them may only address surface-level symptoms. Identifying root causes—such as systemic funding gaps, technological barriers, or skill shortages—ensures that interventions directly tackle the core issues rather than providing temporary fixes.

## Efficiently Allocate Resources

Charities operate on limited budgets and capacity. By pinpointing the exact obstacles (e.g., affordability of digital tools, lack of training, or dependency on outdated systems), resources can be strategically directed to areas that yield the highest impact.

## Create Sustainable Change

Addressing the deeper issues—such as structural inefficiencies, lack of digital adoption, or reliance on outdated fundraising models—ensures that small charities are not just surviving but thriving in the long run. Without fixing these root problems, charities may continue facing the same crises year after year.

## Advocate & Influence Policy

Understanding why small charities struggle allows organizations like Sociatall to push for policy changes and systemic reforms. Whether it's advocating for better digital funding, government support, or sector-wide training initiatives, knowing the root causes strengthens the case for action.

## Build Resilience in the Sector

If small charities continually rely on emergency responses to crises, they remain vulnerable to future shocks. Solving the foundational issues—such as digital exclusion, training deficits, or financial instability—helps build a more resilient sector capable of adapting to future challenges.

## Avoid Misguided Solutions

Without a clear understanding of root causes, well-intentioned solutions may miss the mark. For example, simply providing free software to charities won't help if the real issue is a lack of training on how to use it effectively. A deeper diagnosis ensures that solutions are both relevant and impactful.
