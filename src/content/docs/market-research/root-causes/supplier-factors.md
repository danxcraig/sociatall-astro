The technology marketplace for small charities is not fit for purpose.

* Building and maintaining technology requires significant investment, often requiring private/public funding or debt.
* Grant and donation restrictions exist for private companies which can limit their ability to innovate without passing on costs.
* Most technology organisations serving charities are for-profit, prioritising returns for investors and driving up costs.
* The combination of high costs and systemic inefficiencies makes critical tools inaccessible for many small charities.
* This fragmented and profit-driven software landscape creates a significant barrier to entry for smaller organisations.
