## The Problem
Project-based funding cycles averaging [14.3 months] prevent multi-year digital roadmaps, forcing perpetual short-term tooling decisions.
[89% of charity leaders] report that outdated technology directly impedes service scalability and impact measurement
Volunteer management systems in small charities operate at [47% lower efficiency] than sector benchmarks due to technological limitations
Digital inefficiencies are estimated to reduce overall fundraising effectiveness by 25%, as manual processes and fragmented systems drain valuable time and resources. 4

Only 12% of charities rate their digital skills as excellent.
71% of small charities lack the internal expertise to implement digital solutions.
49% of charities lack a basic digital strategy.
50% of small charities report that a lack of in-house IT expertise significantly impedes their digital transformation efforts. 2

Change Resistance: [Charity Excellence Framework][5] notes that 50% of staff in small charities feel unequipped to adapt to new digital tools due to lack of training and fear of workflow disruption.

## The Facts

## The Drivers

### Gaps In Strategy
Strategic Disconnect: A survey by [Charity Digital](https://x.com/i/grok?text=Charity%20Digital) indicates that only 30% of small charities have a digital strategy that aligns with their overall mission.

Awareness Gap: [Charity Digital Skills Report](https://x.com/i/grok?text=Charity%20Digital%20Skills%20Report) highlights that 65% of charities struggle with understanding what constitutes a basic digital infrastructure.

* Many small charities lack a clearly defined mission, vision, and strategy, making it challenging to align their efforts.
* Where those do exist, digital and operational technology strategies are often disconnected from the broader organisational strategy.
* There is limited awareness of what a "digital baseline" entails, leaving organisations unsure of where to start.
* Decision-making around technology adoption is often fragmented and uncoordinated, leading to inefficiencies and delays.

### Breadth & Depth of Operations

* Small charities must manage an immense breadth of activities, often spanning multiple areas like fundraising, service delivery, and stakeholder engagement, with limited resources.
* Coordination with a wide array of stakeholders, including donors, beneficiaries, volunteers, and regulators, adds significant complexity to daily operations.
* Overwhelmed staff face constant reactive work, leaving no room for proactive planning or long-term strategic initiatives.
* Silos and unclear communication between departments create inefficiencies and duplication of effort.
* Lack of streamlined processes for integrating new tools hinders operational efficiency and exacerbates resistance to change.

### Resistance & Barriers To Change
* Many staff and volunteers lack familiarity with digital tools, reducing the effectiveness of their adoption.
* Training and resources to build internal digital capacity are scarce, leaving organisations ill-prepared for digital transformation.
* Lengthy and complex onboarding processes deter staff and volunteers from embracing new technologies.
* Fear of disruption to existing workflows fosters resistance to change, stalling digital initiatives.
* Without systems to effectively manage data, charities struggle to analyse and leverage donor and beneficiary information.
* Time constraints prevent thorough research, evaluation, and implementation of suitable digital solutions.
