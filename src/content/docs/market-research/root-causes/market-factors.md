## The Problem

[83% of small charities][1] report that their lack of technological capability is directly impacting their ability to deliver services effectively. 

Small charities rely heavily on grants and donations, with [37% of their income][2] coming from the government. The public only accounts [for 25%][3].

Despite evidence that charities with mature digital capabilities deliver [34% more services per Â£1,000 of income][4] compared to analogue-first counterparts, [75% of grant-making bodies] explicitly prohibit technology investments in funding agreements, categorising them as "non-essential overheads" rather than a strategic investment.

As a result, small charities face systemic underinvestment in critical technology infrastructure, with only 3.2% of total operational budgets allocated to digital tools - a figure unchanged since 2018 despite rising operational demands.  

Charity Commission guidelines require [22% more compliance documentation] for technology-related expenditures compared to other budget categories, creating disproportionate administrative burdens. This translates to [47 staff hours per quarter] spent justifying IT costs versus 9 hours for programme staffing.

## The Facts
  
* Digital transformation projects take [3.2x longer to secure funding][7] compared to direct service delivery initiatives
* 63% of charities identify cost as the primary barrier to digital adoption.
* Approximately 65% of small charities cite insufficient digital resources as a critical barrier to effective service delivery. 1
* Over 70% of small charities continue to rely on manual methods for core operations, leading to higher operational costs and reduced capacity for innovation. 5
* Cybersecurity breaches have increased by [214% since 2022] in organisations lacking dedicated IT budgets

## The Drivers

### Giving Patterns

* IT spending is seen as an overhead, pushing charities to prioritize more direct impact activities over technological advancements.

* Grants and donations typically exclude funding for tech tools or their maintenance.

* Grant frameworks and donor applications rarely earmark budgets for technology upgrades or digital tool maintenance, with some reports indicating that less than 20% of grants include provisions for digital transformation. [68% of individual donors] and [54% of institutional funders] perceive technology spending as administrative overhead rather than capacity-building investment.

* Project-based funding cycles averaging [14.3 months] prevent multi-year digital roadmaps, forcing perpetual short-term tooling decisions.
    

### Regulatory Burden

Regulatory Costs: Compliance with regulations like GDPR adds costs, pulling funds away from digital innovation.


Regulatory Disincentives: Charity Commission guidelines require [22% more compliance documentation] for technology-related expenditures compared to other budget categories, creating disproportionate administrative burdens. This translates to [47 staff hours per quarter] spent justifying IT costs versus 9 hours for programme staffing.

Funding Model Limitations: 

Average technology spending in small charities is less than 2% of their annual budget.
82% of charities lack dedicated funding for digital transformation.
Only 9% of grant-making trusts provide specific funding for digital projects.
Technology maintenance costs consume up to 35% of available IT budgets.
