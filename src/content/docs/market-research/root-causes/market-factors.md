## The Problem

In the evolving landscape of charitable funding, the classification of technology expenses—such as hardware and software—remains a critical yet nuanced issue. While these costs are increasingly integral to organisational operations, 

[83% of small charities][1] report that their lack of technological capability is directly impacting their ability to deliver services effectively. 

Small charities rely heavily on grants and donations, with [37% of their income][2] coming from the government. The public only accounts [for 25%][3].

Despite evidence that charities with mature digital capabilities deliver [34% more services per £1,000 of income][4] compared to analogue-first counterparts, [75% of grant-making bodies] explicitly prohibit technology investments in funding agreements, categorising them as "non-essential overheads" rather than a strategic investment.

As a result, small charities face systemic underinvestment in critical technology infrastructure, with only 3.2% of total operational budgets allocated to digital tools - a figure unchanged since 2018 despite rising operational demands.  

Charity Commission guidelines require [22% more compliance documentation] for technology-related expenditures compared to other budget categories, creating disproportionate administrative burdens. This translates to [47 staff hours per quarter] spent justifying IT costs versus 9 hours for programme staffing.

## The Facts
  
* Digital transformation projects take [3.2x longer to secure funding][7] compared to direct service delivery initiatives
* 63% of charities identify cost as the primary barrier to digital adoption.
* Approximately 65% of small charities cite insufficient digital resources as a critical barrier to effective service delivery. 1
* Over 70% of small charities continue to rely on manual methods for core operations, leading to higher operational costs and reduced capacity for innovation. 5
* Cybersecurity breaches have increased by [214% since 2022] in organisations lacking dedicated IT budgets

## The Drivers

### Funding

#### Classification and Perception Challenges

Hardware (e.g., laptops, servers) and software (e.g., CRM systems, cybersecurity tools) can be viewed as either infrastructural investments (core) or project-specific tools (restricted), depending on their application56.  

* Technology expenses occupy an ambiguous hybrid space between infrastructure and project-specific tools
* 68% of individual donors and 54% of institutional funders perceive technology spending as administrative overhead rather than capacity-building investment
* IT spending is broadly viewed as overhead, causing charities to prioritize direct impact activities over technological advancement
* Hardware and software can be classified as either infrastructural investments (core) or project-specific tools (restricted), creating accounting confusion

Restricted Funding Limitations

* Only a minority of grant-makers explicitly permit technology costs within core funding streams
* Only 24% of charities successfully secured any form of digital funding in 2024
* A mere 6% of charities accessed substantial support for digital infrastructure
* 28% report their typical funders do not cover digital costs
* 23% say their typical funders do not cover staff time spent on digital and data activities
* 21% cannot find a funder who supports their specific digital project needs

Resource Allocation Disparities

* Larger charities fare better with 26% reporting funding success compared to 19% of smaller organizations
* Average technology spending in small charities is less than 2% of their annual budget
* Technology maintenance costs consume up to 35% of available IT budgets
* Small charities face higher barriers (49%) compared to large charities (40%)

Structural Funding Problems

* 82% of charities lack dedicated funding for digital transformation
* Only 9% of grant-making trusts provide specific funding for digital projects
* Full Cost Recovery is not consistently included in project funding
* Restricted grants often don't clarify whether technology costs are permitted
* Treatment of technology within funding frameworks varies significantly across funders

Available Funding Streams

* Core/Unrestricted Funding (classified as overheads, indirect costs, or support costs)
* Project-Specific Grants
* Government & Local Authority Grants
* Funder Plus programs
* Dedicated Technology Funds
* Software Donation & Discount Programs
* Tech for good or social tech grants or investments

Technology expenses occupy a hybrid space. 

IT spending is seen as an overhead, pushing charities to prioritize more direct impact activities over technological advancements.

* Core/Unrestricted Funding (https://www.charityexcellence.co.uk/core-costs-funding-for-charities/)

A minority of grant-makers explicitly permit technology costs within core funding streams.

* Project Specific Grants

Can the restricted grant pay for these? Or do your unrestricted funds have to cover these? If permitted in the grantmaker’s criteria, you should always allow for these indirect costs when preparing your grant application. - https://expenseplus.co.uk/blog/receiving-grants-a-guide-for-charities-and-churches/

include overheads or full or partial cost recovery.  Not all include Full Cost Recovery (https://www.ncvo.org.uk/help-and-guidance/running-a-charity/financial-management/planning-and-budgeting/project-budgeting-full-cost-recovery/full-cost-recovery/)

[68% of individual donors] and [54% of institutional funders] perceive technology spending as administrative overhead rather than capacity-building investment.

Only 24% of charities successfully secured any form of digital funding in 2024, with a mere 6% accessing substantial support for infrastructure3. Larger charities fare better, with 26% reporting success compared to 19% of smaller organisations, underscoring disparities in resource allocation3. https://charitydigitalskills.co.uk/report/detailed-findings/digital-funding/

Only 24% of charities successfully secured any form of digital funding in 2024, with a mere 6% accessing substantial support for infrastructure3. 
Larger charities fare better, with 26% reporting success compared to 19% of smaller organisations, underscoring disparities in resource allocation.

    Overall, 45% of charities say the biggest barrier they face is a lack of suitable funding. The figure is the unique proportion of charities facing one or more of the following barriers (recalculated to avoid double counting):

        Their typical funders do not cover digital costs (28%)
        Their typical funders do not cover staff time spent on digital and data (23%)
        They cannot find a funder who supports their digital project (21%).

    This rises to 49% of small charities, compared to 40% of large charities.

their treatment within funding frameworks varies significantly.

### Suppliers

#### Hardware & Software

* Building and maintaining technology requires significant investment, often requiring private/public funding or debt.
* Grant and donation restrictions exist for private companies which can limit their ability to innovate without passing on costs.
* Most technology organisations serving charities are for-profit, prioritising returns for investors and driving up costs.
* The combination of high costs and systemic inefficiencies makes critical tools inaccessible for many small charities.
* This fragmented and profit-driven software landscape creates a significant barrier to entry for smaller organisations.
