In the evolving landscape of charitable funding, the classification of technology expenses—such as hardware and software—remains a critical yet nuanced issue. While these costs are increasingly integral to organisational operations, 

[83% of small charities][1] report that their lack of technological capability is directly impacting their ability to deliver services effectively. 

with 49% of small charities reporting that the biggest barrier they face is a lack of suitable funding[Charity Digital Skills report]. The figure is the unique proportion of charities facing one or more of the following barriers (recalculated to avoid double counting):

        Their typical funders do not cover digital costs (28%)
        Their typical funders do not cover staff time spent on digital and data (23%)
        They cannot find a funder who supports their digital project (21%).

    This rises to 49% of small charities, compared to 40% of large charities.

Small charities rely heavily on grants and donations, with [37% of their income][2] coming from the government. The public only accounts [for 25%][3].

Only 24% of charities successfully secured any form of digital funding in 2024, with a mere 6% accessing substantial support for infrastructure3. Larger charities fare better, with 26% reporting success compared to 19% of smaller organisations, underscoring disparities in resource allocation3. https://charitydigitalskills.co.uk/report/detailed-findings/digital-funding/
ation.

Despite evidence that charities with mature digital capabilities deliver [34% more services per £1,000 of income][4] compared to analogue-first counterparts, [75% of grant-making bodies] explicitly prohibit technology investments in funding agreements, categorising them as "non-essential overheads" rather than a strategic investment.

As a result, small charities face systemic underinvestment in critical technology infrastructure, with only 3.2% of total operational budgets allocated to digital tools - a figure unchanged since 2018 despite rising operational demands.  

Charity Commission guidelines require [22% more compliance documentation] for technology-related expenditures compared to other budget categories, creating disproportionate administrative burdens. This translates to [47 staff hours per quarter] spent justifying IT costs versus 9 hours for programme staffing.

## The Facts
  
* Digital transformation projects take [3.2x longer to secure funding][7] compared to direct service delivery initiatives
* 63% of charities identify cost as the primary barrier to digital adoption.
* Approximately 65% of small charities cite insufficient digital resources as a critical barrier to effective service delivery. 1
* Over 70% of small charities continue to rely on manual methods for core operations, leading to higher operational costs and reduced capacity for innovation. 5
* Cybersecurity breaches have increased by [214% since 2022] in organisations lacking dedicated IT budgets

## The Drivers

### Technology Landscape

For small charities to be effective, they must carry out large range of activities across domains like:

* Impact Reporting & Program Effectiveness
* Board Management & Governance Oversight
* Research & Insight Production
* Awareness & Marketing
* Fundraising & Donor Management
* Program Delivery and Case Management
* Financial Management & Regulatory Compliance
* Employee & Volunteer Management
* Resource & Asset Management
* Cybersecurity & IT Management
* Internal Knowledge Management & Collaboration
* SAR & Complaint Management

The operational complexity that small charities face has created a market opportunity for private companies, resulting in thousands of hardware, software, and service options designed to help charities drive efficiency and effectiveness.

However, understanding, selecting, implementing, using, and maintaining these solutions requires both time and expertise. Small charities must either secure that through donation, or work to secure funds to .

While a completely donated technological infrastructure1 is an ideal, there is a reality underpinning the complexity of achieving it:

* **Cloud and Onsite Infrastructure Providers** - Must pay for raw materials, infrastructure, power, people, R&D, profits,
* **Software Providers** - Building and maintaining technology requires significant investment, often requiring private/public funding or debt.
* **Service Providers** - Grant and donation restrictions exist for private companies which can limit their ability to innovate without passing on costs.

Even with donated resources, coordination remains their responsibility.

Despite intelligent business models like subscription, consumption pricing, pay as you go, freemium, custom, outcome or performance pricing, percentage Open Core, Collective Buying, 

The current options available for Charities are:

* Pay heavy costs for purpose built software.
* Pay
* Pay
* Leverage free or freemium tools

Most charities require funding to achieve technological transformation and continuance.

### Funding Landscape

Technology expenses occupy an ambiguous hybrid space between <span 
    title="<a href='https://www.ivar.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Evidence-review-Why-restrict-grants-IVAR-March-2023-FINAL.pdf'>Definitions borrowed from 'IVAR - Why Restrict Grants?'</a><br/><br/>These are funds that can only be used for the purpose
    specified by the donor. The donor can declare the restrictions when making the gift
    or they can result from the terms of a charity’s appeal for funds. In the UK, restricted
    funding carries the weight of trust law, placing a binding legal obligation on charity
    trustees to spend funds per the restriction. Restrictions can take many forms but
    they typically include specifying activities, budgets, outputs, outcomes, and reporting
    requirements."

    style="text-decoration: underline dotted;"> restricted </span> and <span 
    title="These are funds that can be spent or applied at the
    discretion of the trustees of a charitable organisation to further their charitable
    purposes and mission. These funds do not come with conditions on how the
    organisation should spend them. Other terms sometimes used to describe
    unrestricted funding, especially in international contexts, include ‘flexible funding’
    and ‘general operating support’." 
    data-tooltip-placement="left" 
    style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">unrestricted</span> funding, with hardware (e.g., laptops, servers) and software (e.g., CRM systems, cybersecurity tools) potentially viewed as either infrastructure investment (unrestricted) or project-specific tools (restricted), depending on their application.

UK funders have historically been reticent to support unrestricted funding, for several reasons:

* **Funder Objectives**: Funders often have specific social goals or priorities they want to address. By providing restricted funding, they are able to allocate resources to specific activities which they consider most effective or impactful, thus are able to more clearly align their grants with their societal objectives. [1](https://www.bi.team/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CHARITY_FUTURES_TOTHECORE_REPORT_v2-1.pdf), [2](https://www.ivar.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Evidence-review-Why-restrict-grants-IVAR-March-2023-FINAL.pdf)

* **Impact Validation**: Funders often want to assess the specific impact their contributions made and, in the case of large companies and financial institutions who have regulatory ESG and CSR reporting requirements, often they are required to by law. Restricted funding makes it easier for funders to track and report on the outcomes of particular projects or initiatives, and to enforce accountability through budgets, cost controls, timescales, and performance measurements. [3](https://www.ivar.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Evidence-review-Why-restrict-grants-IVAR-March-2023-FINAL.pdf)

* **Performance Assessment**: Many funders exhibit a preference for charities that spend a lower percentage of their income on core costs. This may be because donors use the size of overheads as a signal of charity effectiveness or feel that covering core costs does not maximize the impact of their donation. [4](https://www.bi.team/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CHARITY_FUTURES_TOTHECORE_REPORT_v2-1.pdf), [5](https://www.charitytoday.co.uk/restricted-funds-could-be-making-a-comeback-and-thats-a-headache-for-finance-teams/)

This tension surrounding technology expenses creates a significant challenge for small UK charities, who must navigate funders resistance to unrestricted funding while simultaneously addressing their legitimate technological needs.
