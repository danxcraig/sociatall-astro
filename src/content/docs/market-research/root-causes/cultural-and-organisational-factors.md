### Giving Patterns

Small charities have severe technology funding constraints.

* Stakeholders, regulators, and donors often view technology spending as an overhead expense rather than a critical investment.
* Regulatory compliance imposes additional costs, diverting resources from technology investments.
* Charities rely heavily on grants and donations, which frequently exclude funding for digital tools or their maintenance.
* High upfront costs, combined with ongoing subscription fees, create financial barriers that many small charities cannot overcome.

## Gaps In Strategy
<details>
<summary>Context</summary>
Technology strategy in small charities is often nascent.

* Many small charities lack a clearly defined mission, vision, and strategy, making it challenging to align their efforts.
* Where those do exist, digital and operational technology strategies are often disconnected from the broader organisational strategy.
* There is limited awareness of what a "digital baseline" entails, leaving organisations unsure of where to start.
* Decision-making around technology adoption is often fragmented and uncoordinated, leading to inefficiencies and delays.

## Breadth & Depth of Operations
<details>
<summary>Context</summary>
The breadth and depth of operations in small charities is intense.

* Small charities must manage an immense breadth of activities, often spanning multiple areas like fundraising, service delivery, and stakeholder engagement, with limited resources.
* Coordination with a wide array of stakeholders, including donors, beneficiaries, volunteers, and regulators, adds significant complexity to daily operations.
* Overwhelmed staff face constant reactive work, leaving no room for proactive planning or long-term strategic initiatives.
* Silos and unclear communication between departments create inefficiencies and duplication of effort.
* Lack of streamlined processes for integrating new tools hinders operational efficiency and exacerbates resistance to change.

## Resistance & Barriers To Change
<details>
<summary>Context</summary>
There's still a long way to go to mature general technology skills.

* Many staff and volunteers lack familiarity with digital tools, reducing the effectiveness of their adoption.
* Training and resources to build internal digital capacity are scarce, leaving organisations ill-prepared for digital transformation.
* Lengthy and complex onboarding processes deter staff and volunteers from embracing new technologies.
* Fear of disruption to existing workflows fosters resistance to change, stalling digital initiatives.
* Without systems to effectively manage data, charities struggle to analyse and leverage donor and beneficiary information.
* Time constraints prevent thorough research, evaluation, and implementation of suitable digital solutions.
