Revenue

* **Private Sector** - 5.27t
* **Public Sector** - 1.1t
* **Third Sector** - 120b (1.8%)

Small to medium-sized charities now receive [only 14.74%][2] of the total available income in the sector, a significant decline from 33.6% in 2000.

Unable to access or afford essential technology and expertise for their under pressure teams, the income and delivery problem is critically compounding for the sector on an annual basis.

As a result of the current politico-socio-economic environment in the UK, [1 in 5 charities][1] have been forced to cut back on the number or scope of services they offer, placing further impact and burden on communities who are already stretched to their limit.

## The Facts
* [54% of charities][3] are facing substantially increased demands on their service.
* [77% of charities][4] are facing substantially increased running costs for their service.
* [40% of charities][1] face significant recruiting challenges.
* Rates of monthly and annual volunteering are at their [lowest levels since records began][5].
* Staff training and development has [fallen by 25% since 2011][1].

### Environmental Degredation

* 59% of Grade 1 agricultural land, 4.6m residential properties, 38% of all roads and railways and 34% of water pumping stations and treatment plants [are at risk of flooding in the UK][33], with significant increases expected by 2050-2060, driven by a [significantly wetter climate][34].

* [Only 14% of rivers and lakes][35] in England have a good ecological status and none have a good chemical status. Sewage is poured into protected habitats for [over 300,000 hours per year][36], and [3 billion litres of water][37] are lost to leaking pipes each day.

* Heat-related deaths in the UK are [set to treble][38] by 2050, driven by rises in summer and winter temperatures which are projected to be up to [5.1°C warmer][39].

* Since 1970, [more than 50%][40] of flowering plants, mosses and relatives have been lost and species have declined [on average by 19%][40]. [One in six][40] are now threatened with extinction.
